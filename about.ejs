    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>
      Skynari Airlines: A Journey from Setbacks to Soaring Success

Skynari Airlines was founded in 2010 with a bold vision: to create an airline that placed people at the heart of air travel. However, despite our clear mission, we faced significant challenges in our early years. Limited funding,
lack of infrastructure, and intense competition from established carriers kept us grounded, with operations restricted to a few regional routes and just a single aircraft.
But we never gave up on our dream. With unwavering determination, strategic planning, and a commitment to excellence, we laid the groundwork for something greater.
By 2015, we had gained the stability, experience, and resources to expand internationally—offering flights to major global destinations while staying true to our hallmark hospitality and reliability.
From that point on, we continuously invested in cutting-edge technology, sustainable aviation practices, and employee development, ensuring that every flight reflected our core values: safety, innovation, and service.
Today, in 2025, fifteen years since our founding, our vision has become a reality. Skynari Airlines now connects millions of passengers across continents and continues to raise the standard for modern air travel—proving that with perseverance and purpose, even the most ambitious dreams can take flight.
